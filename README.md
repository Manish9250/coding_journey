# My Journey With Computers: From MS Paint to a Full-Fledged App 💻

This is the story of how my fascination with computers began and evolved, from a simple curiosity in a school lab to building functional applications. It's a path of trial, error, and eventual triumph. 🚀

## 🌱 The First Spark: School Labs and an Old Pentium 💡

My first real encounter with computers was in my early school days. Our teacher, **Mahesh Sir**, would take us to the computer lab.  
I vividly remember the old PCs booting up with the **Windows XP** logo and that little progress bar—it was love at first sight. ❤️

- He would teach us **MS Paint**. One time, he made groups, filled our screens with black, and asked us to erase it. The tiny default eraser made it seem impossible—but one kid in our group flexed his skills and cleared the whole screen in no time. (I'll let you guess how 😉)

- Sometimes, Sir let us play a **side-scroller game**. It wasn’t Mario, but just as fun. His computer was the fastest, so he’d control the jump (spacebar) while we handled left/right. Most of us barely lasted a few seconds! 🎮

- These lab visits were rare—**only once or twice a year**—but they sparked something in me.

I also remember watching a movie in a **smart class projector**. The quality was low, but as a child my imagination filled in all the gaps. A power we sometimes lose as adults, always demanding better graphics and VFX. 🎬

## 👨‍💻 My Uncle’s Influence: The Old Pentium Laptop

My uncle ("mama"), a **software engineer**, once lived with us.  
He gave me his old **Pentium laptop with 2GB RAM**. I mostly used it for:

- Playing games like **Alien Shooter** (I even ran the second part, but got stuck on the car level—years later I found out I had played only half the game 👾).
- Practicing **typing** and watching old **movie CDs**.

But I had a terrible habit:  
👉 Whenever someone came upstairs, I panicked and **hard-shut down** the PC by pressing the power button. 😱  
Unsurprisingly, one day it refused to turn on. My uncle fixed it with a fresh install of **Windows 7**.  

He also had an old **bag of software CDs**. I experimented with them—spending ages trying to install a broken copy of **Photoshop**. That laptop finally died because of my shutdown habit.

Meanwhile, **Jio’s internet revolution** was happening in India. My PC didn’t have Wi-Fi, but by accident I discovered that plugging in my uncle’s **Wi-Fi dongle USB cable** gave me **USB tethering internet**! 🌐

## ☕ A Challenging Start: My First Tryst with Java

By **8th–9th grade**, my dream was clear:  
👉 Build a **GUI desktop app** for my family’s grocery shop.

YouTube was my only guide. I decided to learn **Java**, influenced by a comment:  
> *“If you know Java, you can learn any language easily.”*

Two big mistakes:  
1. Java enforces **OOP** (way over my head at that time).  
2. The tutorial was in **English**, and I barely understood parts of it.

Still, I watched a **12-hour Java tutorial** using my father’s mobile hotspot at night.  
I learned about **JavaFX** for GUI apps and managed some simple builds, but with only YouTube, getting unstuck was hard.  
Eventually, I felt I wasn’t making progress and stopped. 🛑

## 🐍 The Python Revelation

A year and a half later, in **11th standard**, programming officially entered my school syllabus. The language: **Python** (with NumPy & Matplotlib).

Suddenly, everything clicked:
- Why we use **loops**  
- What **lists and dictionaries** are  
- How **arrays** work  
- Storing data in **DataFrames** and exporting them as **CSV**

With just **loops, if-else, and DataFrames**, I built a small app to track completed chapters for a project.  
The code was messy, but it worked! ✅  
Then a friend told me about **functions**—I rebuilt the app, and it became much cleaner.

This reignited my old dream. I discovered **PyQt** for GUIs.  
- Learned it, and finally made progress.  
- Even understood **classes and objects** in a practical way.  

But then came another bottleneck: **databases**.  
I only knew DataFrames and tried using them as storage, but schema design and relationships were too complex.  
Fearing it wasn’t scalable, I dropped the project again (partially).

Later, I dabbled with **stock market programming** and came across **APIs** for the first time. I didn’t fully understand them, so I used Python SDKs instead. This kept my learning alive. 📈

## 🎓 The Power of Structured Learning

My journey transformed when I joined the **BS Degree in Data Science & Applications from IIT Madras**.  

This gave me **structured learning**. Unlike random YouTube tutorials, here I had:
- A clear path
- No dead ends
- Strong foundations

In the last two years:
- I learned to build **full-stack web apps** (frontend + backend).  
- Built a **service provider app** for a course project.  
- Worked with **LLMs**, building **agents using APIs and models**.  

And finally…  
👉 I built the long-dreamed **GUI shop app** two months ago! 🎉  
It’s a **web app** where frontend and backend run on the same device.  
It works perfectly.

## 🚀 Looking Back

The journey was **long and winding**, but every step—even the “failures” with **Java** and **PyQt**—was a crucial part of the process.  

What started with **MS Paint in a dusty school lab** grew into a passion for programming, and today, I can build full-fledged applications.  

Every small spark mattered. 🔥
